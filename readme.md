Heroku link to my cool new app that uses LinkedIn OAuth... pretty sweet eh? This is all the farther we have gotten so I don't know what the app is going to do... but it will use LinkedIn OAauth... I suppose I could read ahead to see what it is going to be but well then what would I ramble about? What kind of pie is best? Actually that is a great idea. Oh and before I get too far off topic here is that link you have been waiting on. https://powerful-castle-96523.herokuapp.com/

Now back to the pie. Actually screw the pie (*snickers*) let's go with a joke. Did you hear about the hacker who was found guilty and sentenced to death by electric chair for spamming the internet for clickbait?  No? What happens next will shock you then!

Or what's the difference between a peeping tom and a pickpocket? A pickpocket snatches watches... :)
